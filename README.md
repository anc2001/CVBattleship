# CVBattleship
Computer Vision pipeline that connects battleship board to game-state to be interpreted by an AI. 

# Timeline
# # Progress Report 1 (Due April 13)
Should be finished by this point (probably do this in order)
# # # Consistently detect red and white dots on board 
3D kernel for red and white response?

# # # A good approximation of the board corners
Collect feature points and somehow estimate a distance value such that every x y feature point is reachable from another feature through integer multiples of this distance.
Use estimated distance value 

# # #  Some conception of image rectification with found board corners

# # Progress Report 2 (Due April 20) (I think??)
Should be finished by this point
# # #  Can accurately convert board into gamestate
# # #  Pipeline that connects our detector to battleship AI and simulation
# # #  Working version of battleship and/or API that works with our conversion to game states

Presentation (April 26)
# # #  Finish some kind of video demonstration by this point

Final code and report (April 27)
